        <li>Analyze usage to improve user experience and for business analytics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following circumstances:</p>

      <h2>6. Security</h2>

      <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, or as required by law. When data is no longer needed, we securely delete or anonymize it.</p>

      <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or export your personal data, and to restrict or object to processing. To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@zodiacservices.org">info@zodiacservices.org</a>.</p>
